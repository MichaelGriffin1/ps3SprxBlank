This is a basic PS3 SPRX mod template that you can use for any game.
It includes basic PS3 memory editing functions, dialog, and controller input.
All the documentation can be found in the documentation folder!

NOTE: This is not a mod menu base for Call of Duty, or GTA 5. You will have to make
your own HUD UI, and find your own offsets.

If you dont have experience with C++, this will not help that much.

The PS3 SDK is required to compile. Visual studio with intergration is reccomended. 
This was created with Visual Studio 2015.

This is currently set to pop up a dialog, and then segfault the thread after the Ok button
is pressed.

Feel free to contribute to the code if there is an issue you have. It will not only help you, but the other people who will use this as well. Im not the perfect developer. :)
